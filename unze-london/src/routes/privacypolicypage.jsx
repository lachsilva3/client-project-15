     <p>Unze London website may, from time to time, use cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes and they can make the World Wide Web more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular site. The use of cookies is normal practice and many websites use them to provide useful features for their customers. Cookies do not personally identify an individual user of a computer but they do identify the computer being used. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies.</p>    
     <p>We use Google Analytics to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. To capture the required data Google Analytics uses ‘cookies’. An excerpt taken from Google’s privacy policy is below but please visits <a style={{color:'black',textDecoration:'none'}} href='http://www.google.com/privacy.html'><b>http://www.google.com/privacy.html</b></a> if you require further information.</p>    
  <p>How does Google use cookies for Google Analytics?</p>       
        <p>Google Analytics is Google's free web analytics tool that helps website owners understand how their visitors engage with their website. Google Analytics collects information anonymously, and much like examining footprints in sand, it reports website trends without identifying individual visitors. Analytics uses its own cookie to track visitor interactions. The cookie is used to store information, such as the time at which the current visit occurred, whether the visitor has been to the site before and what site referred the visitor to the web page. Google Analytics customers can view a variety of reports about how visitors interact with their website so that they can improve their website and how people find it. A different cookie is used for each website and visitors are not tracked across multiple sites. Analytics requires that all websites that use it must update their privacy policy to include a notice that fully discloses the use of Analytics. To disable this type of cookie, some browsers will indicate when a cookie is being sent and allow you to decline cookies on a case-by-case basis.</p>
